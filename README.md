# SSL Tools

[![Django CI/CD Workflow](https://github.com/annahri/ssl-tools/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/annahri/ssl-tools/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

My first ever django project which is basically a set of SSL tools that I often use for any work related with SSL Certificates.
